## Feature Request: Usage Meter for ChatGPT

**Suggestion**  
Add a built-in usage meter that shows users their approximate interaction statistics with ChatGPT. For example:  
- Total number of conversations  
- Total number of messages exchanged  
- Average conversation length  
- Estimated total time spent interacting  
- Breakdown by model type (GPT-4, GPT-5, etc.)  
- Optional: simple timeline view (usage per week/month)  

This could live in account settings or under a “Your Activity” dashboard.  

**Why**  
Many users are curious about how much they’ve engaged with ChatGPT, but currently there is no transparent way to track this. A usage meter would:  

- Help users understand their engagement habits (learning, productivity, creative work, etc.)  
- Provide useful data for personal tracking and retrospectives (e.g., how study or work patterns evolve)  
- Increase transparency and trust in the platform  
- Potentially encourage responsible usage by giving visibility into time spent  
- Reduce reliance on external estimates or 3rd-party trackers
