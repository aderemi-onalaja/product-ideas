### Feature Request: Apple Maps — Automatic Parking Pin

**Suggestion**  
Enable Apple Maps to automatically drop a “Parked Car” pin when driving ends (e.g., car Bluetooth disconnects and iPhone is stationary for 5 minutes). Show a subtle notification so users can edit, add notes/photos, or dismiss if incorrect.  

**Why**  
Currently, users must manually mark their parking spot, which is easy to forget, especially in large or unfamiliar areas. Automatic detection would save time, reduce frustration, and make Apple Maps feel more intelligent. It also keeps users in the Apple ecosystem instead of relying on third-party “find my car” apps.
