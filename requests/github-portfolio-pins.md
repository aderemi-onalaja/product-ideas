# Feature Request: Portfolio-Style Pinned Repositories

**Suggestion**  
Enable users to add **snippets, images, and custom notes** directly into the pinned repository cards on their profile.  
For example, allowing a small Markdown preview (code block, image thumbnail, or short description beyond the repo tagline).  

**Why**  
Pinned repos are the first thing visitors see, but they currently only show the repo name and a short description.  
Many developers and researchers use GitHub as a **portfolio** to showcase their skills.  

Allowing richer previews (snippets, screenshots, badges) would:  
- Highlight work more effectively without requiring extra clicks  
- Give recruiters, collaborators, and clients immediate context  
- Make GitHub profiles more competitive against dedicated portfolio platforms  
- Reduce the need to build external portfolio sites just to present the same projects
