Suggestion
Add an opt-in “Local Listening” mode that lets users share (anonymously) the track they’re currently playing with others on the same mobile network cell in a small radius (e.g., Central London). No profiles or usernames shown—only aggregated, real-time “what’s playing nearby.”

Entry points: Now Playing menu toggle; Settings → Privacy → Local Listening.

Views:

Nearby Now: top tracks/artists trending within your current cell/area (updated live).

Spots: quick filters for “High Street,” “Station,” “Venue Mode” (auto-suggested near stadiums/clubs).

Controls: radius (auto by cell), update cadence (e.g., every 5–10 mins), data saver, “hide explicit.”

Discovery hooks: tap a track to play, save, or open the artist page; “Join the vibe” mini-playlist auto-built from local top 20.

Safety: only shows results when k-anonymous (e.g., ≥20 active participants); adds light noise to counts; no precise location stored or displayed.

Anti-spam: ignore tracks skipped <30s; jailbreak/root and emulator heuristics; rate-limits to prevent spoofing.

Why

Captures the curiosity of the moment (“what’s everyone vibing to in Central?”) without compromising privacy.

Creates serendipitous discovery tied to place—great for city centres, campuses, festivals, match days.

Encourages more plays and saves via social proof (local charts refresh constantly).

Differentiates Spotify with a privacy-first, real-time local layer (no usernames, no DMs, no map pings).

Scalable: leverages existing mobile network cell/area signals and aggregate analytics; low battery impact with batched updates.
