# Spotify Feature Suggestion – Local Listening Mode

## Suggestion
Add an **opt-in “Local Listening” mode** that lets users share (anonymously) the track they’re currently playing with others on the same mobile network cell in a small radius (e.g., Central London).  
No profiles or usernames shown—only aggregated, real-time “what’s playing nearby.”

### Entry Points
- Now Playing menu toggle  
- Settings → Privacy → Local Listening  

### Views
- **Nearby Now**: top tracks/artists trending within your current cell/area (updated live)  
- **Spots**: quick filters for “High Street,” “Station,” “Venue Mode” (auto-suggested near stadiums/clubs)  

### Controls
- Radius (auto by cell)  
- Update cadence (e.g., every 5–10 mins)  
- Data saver toggle  
- “Hide explicit” filter  

### Discovery Hooks
- Tap a track to play, save, or open the artist page  
- “Join the vibe” mini-playlist auto-built from local top 20  

### Safety
- Only shows results when **k-anonymous** (e.g., ≥20 active participants)  
- Adds light noise to counts  
- No precise location stored or displayed  

### Anti-Spam
- Ignore tracks skipped <30s  
- Jailbreak/root and emulator heuristics  
- Rate-limits to prevent spoofing

## Why
- Captures the **curiosity of the moment** (“what’s everyone vibing to in Central?”) without compromising privacy  
- Creates **serendipitous discovery** tied to place—great for city centres, campuses, festivals, match days  
- Encourages **more plays and saves** via social proof (local charts refresh constantly)  
- Differentiates Spotify with a **privacy-first, real-time local layer** (no usernames, no DMs, no map pings)  
- **Scalable**: leverages existing mobile network cell/area signals and aggregate analytics; low battery impact with batched updates
