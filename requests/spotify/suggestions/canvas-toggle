# Spotify Product Suggestion – Toggle Canvas ⇄ Artwork

## Suggestion  
Allow users to toggle **Canvas ⇄ static album artwork** by tapping the artwork in the Now Playing screen.  

- **Single tap** on the artwork switches from Canvas (looping video) to the track’s static cover art, and back.  
- **Optional long-press:** “Set default for songs with Canvas: [Always Canvas / Always Artwork / Remember per song].”  
- **Small on-screen hint** (e.g., “Tap to view artwork”) shown the first time a Canvas plays.  

## Why  
- **Focus & preference:** Some listeners prefer static art over motion while reading lyrics or studying mixes.  
- **Accessibility:** Reduces motion for users sensitive to animation without disabling Canvas globally.  
- **Battery/data:** Static art uses less power and mobile data than looping video.  
- **Consistency for libraries/DJs:** Quick way to view the official cover for identification and screenshots.  
- **Shareability:** Easier to capture or share a clean cover image.  
- **Low friction:** Uses existing UI real estate; no new buttons needed, and maps to a familiar “tap to toggle” pattern.
