# Chrome Extension: AI Fit-Review Filter

## Suggestion
A Chrome extension that lets shoppers query product reviews by intent and instantly filters to only the relevant lines (e.g., type “how they fit”, “true to size”, “wide feet”, “narrow”, “heel slips”).  
**Key behaviours:**
- Works on major retailers (Amazon, Nike, Zara, ASOS, etc.); generic fallback for any site with review blocks.
- Inline search bar + quick chips: **Fit, Sizing, Comfort, Quality, Material, Colour**.
- Extracts & highlights matched sentences within each review; jump-to-next-highlight navigation.
- Generates a mini consensus summary (e.g., “~68% true-to-size, 22% run small, 10% run large”) with call-outs for width.
- Language-aware: UK/US size terms (“trainers/sneakers”, half sizes, EU/UK/US conversions).
- Privacy-first: prefer on-device NLP; optional cloud mode for very long pages.
- One-click copy/share of the fit summary as text or PNG.
- Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `/` to focus search; `n`/`p` to move between highlights).

## Why
Shoppers waste time sifting through hundreds of generic reviews to answer one question: **how does it fit?** Most retail sites don’t expose intent-level filters. An AI-powered filter surfaces only sizing/fit statements, shows consensus at a glance, reduces decision friction, and helps cut returns from poor fit—saving time for users and money for retailers.
