# Feature Request: Auto Convert SVG to PNG

## Suggestion
Enable GitHub to automatically generate a PNG preview when an SVG file is uploaded to a repository. This could be similar to how GitHub already renders Markdown or Jupyter Notebook previews. The PNG would appear alongside the SVG in the file view or repository assets.

## Why
- SVGs donâ€™t always render consistently across browsers, and not all users are comfortable working with raw vector files.  
- PNG previews would make visual assets easier to view quickly inside GitHub without leaving the platform.  
- Improves accessibility for recruiters, designers, or collaborators who just want to *see* the graphic without downloading.  
- Reduces the need for contributors to manually export and upload duplicate PNG versions.
