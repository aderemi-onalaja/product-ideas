# Feature Request: iMessage "Send Later" via Send Button Shortcut

**Suggestion**  
Move the “Send Later” option to the send button flow in iMessage. A long-press (or second-tap) on the blue send arrow would open a redesigned sheet that combines **Effects** and a new **Schedule** tab.  

Schedule tab includes:  
- Quick chips (Tonight, Tomorrow 9am, This Weekend)  
- Date/time picker  
- “Send at…” confirmation button  

Inline affordances:  
- After picking a time, the send arrow shows a small clock badge  
- The scheduled message bubble shows “Scheduled • 09:00” label  
- New “Scheduled” list available in conversation info  

**Why**  
Currently, “Send Later” is buried in the “+” menu alongside unrelated features (Photos, Stickers, etc.), which reduces discoverability and speed. The “Send with effect” sheet is a dead-end, despite being the logical last step for sending actions.  

Re-anchoring scheduling to the **send button** flow improves:  
- **Discoverability**: Users find it where they expect — at the point of sending.  
- **Efficiency**: Fewer taps and less menu-hunting.  
- **Consistency**: Aligns scheduling with other last-step send actions (effects).  
- **User experience**: Provides inline visual cues and a dedicated management view.
